Description: Used for fitting the factor-adjusted VAR model proposed in Barigozzi, Cho and Owens (2021),where strong cross-sectional dependence is accounted for by factors and the remaining idiosyncratic dependence
    is modelled by a sparse vector autoregression. Methods for estimating the Granger, Contemporaneous, and Long-Run Partial Correlation networks are provided, as well as forecasting methods for both components.
